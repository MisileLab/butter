You need to install binary wheel manually from [fairseq-butter](https://github.com/MisileLab/fairseq-butter/releases/tag/v0.12.3.1) and [rvc-python-butter](https://github.com/MisileLab/rvc-python-butter/releases/tag/0.2.0)
(or you can install [rvc-python-butter](https://github.com/MisileLab/rvc-python-butter/releases/tag/0.2.0) only when you can build fairseq)
